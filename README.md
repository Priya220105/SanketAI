# SanketAI  
AI-powered Sign Language Learning Platform for Bharat

SanketAI is a learning-first sign language platform that enables deaf and hard-of-hearing learners to practice signs independently using real-time AI-based gesture recognition and corrective feedback.

Unlike detection-only systems, SanketAI provides explainable feedback on hand shape, orientation, and movement, reducing dependence on constant instructor supervision.
