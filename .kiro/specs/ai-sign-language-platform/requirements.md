# SanketAI – Requirements Document

## 1. Problem Statement
India has over 27 million deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals, but access to trained sign language educators is extremely limited, especially in rural and Tier-2/3 regions. Existing learning solutions are static, teacher-dependent, or require high bandwidth, making them unsuitable for Bharat-scale inclusion.

## 2. Objective
To build an AI-powered, interactive sign language learning platform that enables learners to practice Indian Sign Language (ISL) independently using real-time gesture recognition and intelligent, multilingual feedback.

## 3. Target Users
- Deaf and hard-of-hearing students
- Children and parents learning together
- Special educators and teachers
- NGOs and inclusion programs
- Rural and low-bandwidth communities

## 4. Functional Requirements
- Webcam-based real-time sign capture
- On-device hand detection and preprocessing
- Real-time sign recognition for ISL gestures
- Accuracy calculation and progress tracking
- Instant corrective feedback (hand shape, orientation, movement)
- Multilingual feedback (English, Hindi, extendable to regional languages)
- Beginner to advanced learning levels
- Split-screen learning mode (reference sign + webcam feed)
- Offline-first operation with optional cloud sync

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements
- Low latency for real-time feedback
- Works on basic laptops/tablets with webcams
- Offline-first and low-bandwidth friendly
- Scalable for schools and NGOs
- Secure handling of learner data

## 6. Constraints
- Limited internet availability in rural areas
- No special hardware allowed
- Must be easy to use for children and non-technical users

## 7. Success Metrics
- Improvement in sign accuracy over time
- Learner engagement and completion rates
- Adoption by schools and NGOs
